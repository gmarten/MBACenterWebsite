                                    <h3>Could you start by telling us a little about yourself? </h3>

                                     Throughout the years, my taste for effort has pushed me to climb mountains in all areas, pacing myself over the distance 
                                     to achieve personal and professional challenges, such as designing jets for the NASA, running the 400-meter race in 51 seconds or
                                      writing short story collections. During my year-long employment at NASA, I was a systems engineer and manager of cost modeling, analyzing
                                      the financial feasibility of new technologies on missions to collect rock samples on Mars, the Moon, Venus and Mercury. I was also a 
                                      project director and designer for the technology mass sensitivity project, developing models to estimate the effects of technology 
                                      improvements on spacecraft total mass. With each accomplishment, I learned that hard work was in fact the key to being creative. Indeed,
                                      I found that mastery of basic concepts, techniques and forms was the best way to free myself in any discipline and to reach new levels 
                                      of inspiration and true originality. In everything that I do, I look for this almost miraculous moment where the conscious effort to
                                      learn disappears and the mind is liberated to build something new. This quest for creative mastery is what matters the most to me. I 
                                      want to live many lives, to be an endless discoverer and explorer.

                                    <p> 
                                     My goals are realistic and I have quite a few assets to succeed at them. First and foremost, I am truly passionate about what I do and
                                     about constantly getting better at it â€“ this determination is at the heart of who I am, and it was the fuel for my decision to undertake
                                     an MBA education. Furthermore, I want to develop my existing skills in organizational behavior, finance and high-level negotiations.
                                     Finally, I want to develop more advanced leadership skills and have a better awareness of cross-cultural environments, key assets that
                                     all MBA graduates must strive for.

                                    <h3>Why did you choose Stanford? </h3>
                                    <p>
	                                   Joining the Stanford Graduate School of Business is undoubtedly the best way for me to meet my goals. Only Stanford, especially as it
	                                   adopts its new curriculum model, will let me meet these learning objectives. In addition to its academic cutting-edge, the school keeps
	                                   a human size and encourages small-group interactions between students and faculty members. The new curriculum model promises to pay even
	                                   more attention to this human-touch dimension. It is totally tailored to train global leaders. All the Stanford alumni that I have talked
	                                   to recalled having lunch with their former professors, and in some cases even getting invited for dinner parties at their homes. The
	                                   combination of intellectual rigor and interpersonal availability is exactly what I need. Stanford has an environment that will
	                                   positively respond to my proactive involvement in the learning process.

                                      Find a good GMAT coach! I give a lot of credit to my coach at the MBA Center Paris, who developed a great technique to improve my reading
                                      comprehension. I saw a big difference between my first two GMAT scores on the verbal part. I earned a GMAT score of 720 on the second
                                      sitting and a 680 on the first. Thanks to a good coach, I improved my scores significantly.
