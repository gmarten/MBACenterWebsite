                        Hubert Silly came in the Test Prep Industry when he first prepared the GMAT in 1992 and got a perfect score.
                        As the only French person to have received a perfect score in the GMAT, he was rapidly contacted by publishers
                        (Studyrama and Ellipses) who offered him to share his secrets.
                    </p>
                    <p class="animated delay1 fadeInUp">
                        At that time the only Test Prep center in Paris was Kaplan. Thus, Hubert Silly decided to use his expertise to
                        develop a test prep center that would offer more individualized and more comprehensive services: The MBA Center was born!
                    </p>
                    <p class="animated delay1 fadeInUp">
                        Today, individualized and comprehensive services are common place market in the test prep industry, but Hubert Silly was
                        the first one to understand very well where the test prep would head.

                    <h3 class="animated delay1 fadeInDown">A glimpse into the future</h3>
                    <p class="animated delay1 fadeInUp">
                        Between 1996-2009 The MBA Center developed schools in the UK, Belgium, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Switzerland,
                        Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic. Since the world financial crisis, the private education sector has suffered a big
                        change, and those prep centers that weren't able to adapt to the changing primary needs and conditions of prospective students
                        are slowly disappearing.
                    </p>
                    <p class="animated delay1 fadeInUp">
                        Today, with the competition of free online classes, The MBA Center is reassessing the model of a test Prep Center. We have
                        understood that in the future MBA will be mainly present on online market places, institutional centers and bookshops.
                    </p>
                    <p class="animated delay1 fadeInUp">
                        In order to adapt to the student's needs and keep offering an advantage we will soon offer a complete online learning
                        platform with online diagnostic tests and access to all course material for all our students.
